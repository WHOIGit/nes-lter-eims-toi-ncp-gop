In order to calculate net community production (NCP) rates on Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) transect cruises, gas tracer data were collected with a continuous at-sea mass spectrometer. The ratio of O2/Ar, measured continuously from underway water, yields 8,000-15,000 rates of NCP per cruise. Discrete water samples (N=100 to 150 per cruise) were collected for triple oxygen isotope (TOI) analysis to estimate gross primary
production (GPP) rates and ratios of NCP/GPP. Along-shelf (upstream-downstream) transects were conducted in addition to the main across-shelf transect.
This data package provides two types of data tables for NES-LTER transect cruises beginning in 2018: a high-frequency continuous Equilibration Inlet Mass Spectrometer (EIMS) table, provided by year, and a low-frequency discrete triple oxygen isotope (TOI) table with all years combined. Rates calculated from these measurements are provided as separate packages, per year, in the EDI repository.
