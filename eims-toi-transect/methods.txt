# Bottle sample seawater supplied to mass spectrometer

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. Samples are collected in custom-made evacuated glass sample bottles that have been poisoned previously with 100 μL saturated mercuric chloride solution (Emerson et al. 1999). Samples were processed post-cruise.

# Underway science seawater supplied to the EIMS

Continuously during R/V Endeavor cruises, underway science seawater is supplied from 5-m water depth by two separate pumps: a diaphragm pump and an impeller pump. The EIMS samples [at approximately 20-sec intervals] from the diaphragm-pump supply unless otherwise noted. Samples were processed aboard the ship.

# Calibrations and Derivations

The data has been calibrated according to the ratio measured in air roughly every 6 hours. This gives the calibrated O2/Ar ratio that was then used to calculate rates of NCP. This data also includes the biological saturation – the O2/Ar divided by the equilibrium value of O2/Ar – which gives the expected super (or under) saturation of O2 based on biological factors. The solubility of T and S were used to derive this value.

# Data Cleaning

For the bottle samples, a field was added to indicate whether the bottle was sampled from underway or niskin. Additionally, cast number was supplied from the REST API bottle summary and the date-time (in UTC) was corrected to reflect the time at which the rosette bottle closed. Data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-eims-toi-ncp-gop. 

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges.
