# Underway science seawater supplied to the Equilibrator Inlet Mass Spectrometer (EIMS)

A custom-built EIMS system was configured for automated measurement of oxygen and argon concentrations in the uncontaminated seawater flow in the ship’s lab. The system consists of a Hiden Hal 3F quadrupole mass spectrometer, compact pumping station for the mass spectrometer, equilibrator cartridge and various small pumps for air and water. Measurements were made approximately every 30 seconds. On cruise EN608, measurements were made with a Pfeiffer Prismaplus quadrupole mass spectrometer approximately every 12 seconds. Continuously during R/V Endeavor cruises, underway science seawater was supplied from 5-m water depth by two separate pumps: a diaphragm pump and an impeller pump; when possible we supplied water to the EIMS from the diaphragm pump. The Endeavor underway lines are not bleached but rather are flushed with freshwater before each cruise. On R/V Neil Armstrong cruises, underway science seawater was supplied from 2.1336-m water depth by a diaphragm pump. 

Cruise-specific pump information:
EN608: Used diaphragm first, then switched to impleller 1 Feb 08:18 UTC;
EN617: Diaphragm for first two days, then switched to impeller due to bubbles in diaphragm supply in rougher weather;
EN627: Diaphragm first with new debubbler for EIMS, then switched to impeller due to air dissolved in diaphragm supply in rougher weather;
EN644: Diaphragm with debubbler.
[Additional cruises, not in this package: EN649: Diaphragm pump with inlet newly lower in sea chest to reduce bubbling; EN655: Diaphragm.]

# Bottle sample seawater supplied post-cruise to mass spectrometer

Discrete samples for triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) and for additional measurements of O2/Ar ratios were collected from the underway science seawater supplied by diaphragm pump and from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. Niskin bottles were checked for integrity with respect to gases. Samples are collected in custom-made 500-mL evacuated glass sample bottles that have been poisoned previously with 100 μL saturated mercuric chloride solution (Emerson et al. 1999). Samples were processed post-cruise for TOI following the methods of Stanley et al. (2015).

# Calibrations and derivations

The EIMS data have been calibrated according to the ratio measured in air roughly every 6 hours. This provides the calibrated O2/Ar ratio, which can be used to calculate rates of NCP (see Related packages, below). Biological saturation, or biosat, the percent supersaturation or undersaturation of O2 due to biological factors, is calculated as the calibrated O2/Ar ratio divided by the equilibrium value of O2/Ar (which is based on temperature and salinity) and expressed as a percentage. The EIMS data table includes high-frequency air-corrected O2/Ar ratio and the biological saturation value for the underway data. The TOI bottle data table consists of O2/Ar and TOI data for the bottle samples. Note that in some cases a rosette bottle at the surface and an underway discrete may be taken at approximately the same time, thus two rows in the discrete (low-frequency) table would match in time to one row in the underway (high-frequency) table.

# Data cleaning

PI Stanley exported a subset of columns from Matlab format into csv format for input to the workflow to assemble this data package; these input data files are provided as zip files. Data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. For the TOI bottle samples, a column was added to indicate whether the bottle was sampled from underway or Niskin. The package input data used Niskin = 0 and depth = 0 to signify underway samples; in the data product, this depth of underway samples is converted from 0 m to the depth of the ship's underway intake. For underway samples from R/V Endeavor, depth is 5 meters below the sea surface. For underway samples from R/V Neil Armstrong, depth is 2.13 meters below the sea surface. For bottle samples from Niskins, depth is supplied from the REST API bottle summary (i.e., measured depth) which is more accurate than depth_matlab. Additionally, cast number was supplied from the REST API bottle summary and the date-time (in UTC) was corrected to reflect the time at which the rosette bottle closed. In the EIMS data set, two records measured precisely at midnight have been omitted due to the lack of time code conversion.

# Quality assurance

We checked each cruise event log to confirm time periods of continuous EIMS and number of discrete TOI underway (and rosette logs to confirm number of discrete TOI Niskin).  We identified when a provided datetime, location, depth, or niskin number was unexpected, excluded EIMS data when time was missing, and plotted data for visual inspection. We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges.
