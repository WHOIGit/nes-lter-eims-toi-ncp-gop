This data package provides net community production (NCP) and gross oxygen production (GOP, a measure of gross primary production) for the winter, summer, and fall Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) Transect cruises in 2018. Two tables are provided: a high-frequency table with NCP rates calculated from measurements of O2/Ar made continuously by an at-sea equilibrator inlet mass spectrometer (EIMS), and a low-frequency table with both NCP and GOP rates calculated for discrete samples measured post-cruise. The GOP rates were calculated from triple O2 isotopic (TOI) ratios. These data are derived from the EIMS and TOI data for the NES-LTER Transect cruises in EDI data package knb-lter-nes.6.3.
