# Source data

These data are derived from the underway Equilibration Inlet Mass Spectrometer (EIMS) O2/Ar ratios and bottle triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) and O2/Ar ratios published in the data package titled "Oxygen-argon dissolved gas ratios using Equilibrator Inlet Mass Spectrometry (EIMS) and triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) from NES-LTER Transect cruises, ongoing since 2018" with identifier knb-lter-nes.6.3 in the EDI Data Portal. 

Additional data sources for these derived data:
-- Gas transfer velocity (monthly mean 10-m wind data product, NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1 data provided by the NOAA PSL, Boulder, Colorado, USA, at https://psl.noaa.gov )
-- Temperature from NES-LTER ship-provided data
-- Salinity from NES-LTER ship-provided data

# Additional cruise notes

AR31A: Approximately 10 hrs of high-frequency data are missing (2018-10-22 from 12:41 to 22:20).

# Calibrations and derivations

The high-freqency NCP data table is derived from the underway EIMS measurements published in package knb-lter-nes.6.2 and includes the gas transfer velocity (k) and net community production (NCP, millimol/m2/day) integrated over the mixed layer. The discrete rates data table is derived from the surface bottle data included in package knb-lter-nes.6.3 and includes discrete NCP (millimol/m2/day), gross oxygen production (GOP, millimol/m2/day), and NCP/GOP ratio. Note that in some cases a rosette bottle at the surface and an underway discrete may be taken at approximately the same time, thus two rows in the discrete (low-frequency) table would match to one row in the underway (high-frequency) table. Data were collected and analyzed and NCP and GOP were calculated following Smith et al. (2021). 

# Data cleaning and assembly

For the discrete rates data table, a column was added to indicate whether the bottle was sampled from underway or Niskin, and quality is indicated using IODE Primary Level flags: 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data. For bottle samples from Niskins, datetime (in UTC) was corrected to reflect the time at which the rosette bottle closed instead of cast start time; latitude_API and longitude_API are based on datetime_utc. Any records with the following conditions were excluded from the data product: a cast start time or a Niskin not found in API bottle summary, a time difference from API bottle summary record greater than 60 minutes or a depth difference greater than 5 m, a missing time value, a Niskin sample with a provided depth of zero, or an underway sample with a nonzero provided depth. Data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-eims-toi-ncp-gop. 

# Quality assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. We completed visual inspections of plots of the reported parameters. We provided quality flags as explained above. 

# Differences from previous version

In version 3, temperature and salinity are included in the high-frequency data set. Column headers for date/time, latitude, longitude, and depth are edited to remove references to Matlab, instead using the word "input" where needed to distinguish from NES-LTER API-derived metadata. The units of NCP were updated to exclude the element name (oxygen) from the unit and instead include it in the attribute definition; the multiplier to SI units was also corrected. The EN617 high-frequency data (and resultant NCP values) now include a correction that aligns EIMS data with bottle sample values. One additional row (EN608 2018-02-01 00:00:01) is added to the high-frequency data set. One discrete sample (EN617 2018-07-24 15:33) previously labeled as sourced from Niskin is corrected to underway, and several samples that were excluded in previous versions are now included and flagged 3 (questionable). 

Version 2 is combined with (and deprecates) previous package knb-lter-nes.7, and excludes some rows in previous version gop-transect csv for reasons described above.
