# Source data

These data are derived from the underway Equilibration Inlet Mass Spectrometer (EIMS) O2/Ar ratios and bottle triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) and O2/Ar ratios published in the data package titled "Oxygen-argon dissolved gas ratios using Equilibrator Inlet Mass Spectrometry (EIMS) and triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) from NES-LTER Transect cruises, ongoing since 2018" with identifier knb-lter-nes.6.3 in the EDI Data Portal. 

Additional data sources for these derived data:
-- Gas transfer velocity (wind data product, weighted over 30 days)
-- Temperature from NES-LTER ship-provided data
-- Salinity from NES-LTER ship-provided data

# Additional cruise notes

AR34B: Some high-frequency data are missing from the first and last days of the cruise. AR34B and AR39B: No underway TOI data are available due to contamination. (Niskin TOI data are included in the package.)

# Calibrations and derivations

The high-frequency NCP data table is derived from the underway EIMS measurements published in package knb-lter-nes.6.2 and includes the gas transfer velocity (k) and net community production (NCP, millimol/m2/day) integrated over the mixed layer. The discrete rates data table is derived from the surface bottle data included in package knb-lter-nes.6.2 and includes discrete NCP (millimol/m2/day), gross oxygen production (GOP, millimol/m2/day), and NCP/GOP ratio. Note that in some cases a rosette bottle at the surface and an underway discrete may be taken at approximately the same time, thus two rows in the discrete (low-frequency) table would match to one row in the underway (high-frequency) table. Data were collected and analyzed and NCP and GOP were calculated following Smith et al. (2021). 

# Data cleaning and assembly

For the discrete rates data table, a column was added to indicate whether the bottle was sampled from underway or Niskin, and quality is indicated using IODE Primary Level flags: 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data. For bottle samples from Niskins, the provided Niskin number and cast start time (column datetime_input) were used to find the corresponding CTD bottle summary record; cast, time stamp (time of rosette bottle closure, datetime_utc), and coordinates (latitude_API and longitude_API) were thus provided from the CTD bottle summary. Data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-eims-toi-ncp-gop. 

# Quality assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. We completed visual inspections of plots of the reported parameters. We provided quality flags as explained above. 

# Differences from previous version

In version 3, data from fall cruise AR39B have been added, completing the set of NES-LTER cruises in 2019. Metadata corrections have been made to several rows of the discrete rates data previously provided, and these resulted in a net addition of 10 observations compared to those included from the same three cruises in v2. In the high-frequency data table, the one record measured precisely at midnight that was previously omitted is now included with a time stamp of 00:00:01. 

Also in version 3, temperature and salinity are included in the high-frequency data set. Column headers for date/time, latitude, longitude, and depth are edited to remove references to Matlab, instead using the word "input" where needed to distinguish from NES-LTER API-derived metadata. The units of NCP were updated to exclude the element name (oxygen) from the unit and instead include it in the attribute definition; the multiplier to SI units was also corrected. 

Version 2 is combined with (and deprecates) previous package knb-lter-nes.15, and excludes some rows in previous version gop-transect csv for reasons described above.
