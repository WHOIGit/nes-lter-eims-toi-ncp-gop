# Source data

These data are derived from the underway Equilibration Inlet Mass Spectrometer (EIMS) O2/Ar ratios and bottle triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) and O2/Ar ratios published in the data package titled "Oxygen-argon dissolved gas ratios using Equilibrator Inlet Mass Spectrometry (EIMS) and triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) from NES-LTER Transect cruises, ongoing since 2018" with identifier knb-lter-nes.6.2 in the EDI Data Portal. 

Additional data sources for these derived data:
-- Gas transfer velocity (wind data product, weighted over 30 days)
-- Temperature from NES-LTER ship-provided data
-- Salinity from NES-LTER ship-provided data

# Cruise notes

AR34B: Some high-frequncy data are missing from the first and last days of the cruise. No underway TOI data are available for this cruise due to contamination. (Niskin TOI data are included in the package.)

# Calibrations and derivations

The high-freqency NCP data table is derived from the underway EIMS measurements published in package knb-lter-nes.6.2 and includes the gas transfer velocity (k) and net community production (NCP, millimol/m2/day) integrated over the mixed layer. The discrete rates data table is derived from the surface bottle data included in package knb-lter-nes.6.2 and includes discrete NCP (millimol/m2/day), gross oxygen production (GOP, millimol/m2/day), and NCP/GOP ratio. Note that in some cases a rosette bottle at the surface and an underway discrete may be taken at approximately the same time, thus two rows in the discrete (low-frequency) table would match to one row in the underway (high-frequency) table. Data were collected and analyzed and NCP and GOP were calculated following Smith et al. (2021). 

# Data cleaning and assembly

In the high-frequency data table, one record measured precisely at midnight was omitted due to the lack of time code conversion. For the discrete rates data table, a column was added to indicate whether the bottle was sampled from underway or Niskin, and quality is indicated using IODE Primary Level flags: 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data. For bottle samples from Niskins, datetime (in UTC) was corrected to reflect the time at which the rosette bottle closed instead of cast start time; latitude_API and longitude_API are based on datetime_utc. Any records with the following conditions were excluded from the data product: a cast start time or a Niskin not found in API bottle summary, a time difference from API bottle summary record greater than 60 minutes or a depth difference greater than 5 m, a missing time value, a Niskin sample with a provided depth of zero, or an underway sample with a nonzero provided depth. Data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-eims-toi-ncp-gop. 

# Quality assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. We completed visual inspections of plots of the reported parameters. We provided quality flags as explained above.
