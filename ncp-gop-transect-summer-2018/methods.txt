# Source data

These data are derived from the underway Equilibration Inlet Mass Spectrometer (EIMS) ratio of oxygen and argon and bottle triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) published in the data package titled "Oxygen-argon dissolved gas ratios and triple oxygen isotopes from NES-LTER Transect cruises, ongoing since 2018" with identifier knb-lter-nes.6.1 in the EDI Data Portal. 

Additional data sources for these derived data:
-- Gas transfer velocity (wind data product, weighted over 30 days)
-- Temperature from NES-LTER ship-provided data
-- Salinity from NES-LTER ship-provided data

# Calibrations and Derivations

The NCP data table is derived from the rates data from the underway system in package knb-lter-nes.6.1 and includes the gas transfer velocity (k) and net community production (NCP, micromol/m2/day) integrated over the mixed layer. The discrete rates data table is derived from the surface-only bottle data in package knb-lter-nes.6.1 and includes the discrete NCP (micromol/m2/day), gross oxygen production (GOP, micromol/m2/day), and NCP/GOP ratio. Note that in some cases a rosette bottle at the surface and an underway discrete may be taken at approximately the same time, thus two rows in the discrete (low-frequency) table would match to one row in the underway (high-frequency) table.

# Data Cleaning

For the bottle samples, a field was added to indicate whether the bottle was sampled from underway or niskin. Additionally, cast number was supplied from the REST API bottle summary and the date-time (in UTC) was corrected to reflect the time at which the rosette bottle closed. Data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-eims-toi-ncp-gop. 

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges.
