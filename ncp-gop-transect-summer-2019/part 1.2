<div dir="ltr">Hi<div><br></div><div>Here are all the files for En644. Once again I don&#39;t have cast numbers yet since that is something I will be doing going forward but I did include niskin and depth in the bottle file. Also, some of the bottle data in this cruise had weird values and I flagged those as &quot;bad data&quot; in the calculated ncpa nd gop discrete rates -- so in the discrete rate file, there is an extra column with a &quot;1&quot; if the data is suspect. If you want, I can just get rid of all the suspect data and delete it but I didn&#39;t know if that was good data practice (since I don&#39;t understand why the values are so weird -- thye are just super low and don&#39;t agree with the EIMS so I think it was a problem with how the data was collected).Â </div><div><br></div><div>Cheers, Rachel</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
