This data package provides the net community production (NCP) and gross oxygen production (GOP, a measure of gross primary production) for the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) winter Transect cruise EN627 in 2019. Two tables are provided: a high-frequency table with NCP rates calculated from measurements of O2/Ar made continuously by an at-sea equilibrator inlet mass spectrometer (EIMS), and a low-frequency table with both NCP and GOP rates calculated for discrete samples measured post-cruise. The GOP rates were calculated from triple O2 isotopic (TOI) ratios. This data package is derived from the EIMS and TOI data for the NES-LTER winter Transect cruise EN627 in a separate EDI data package referenced in the Methods below.
