I couldn't include the cast numbers b/c these were past that point in the workflow (and I didn't have the files handy to redo those steps). But hopefully I can start doing that for the armstrong cruises which I will move on to next.

depth cutoff is 6 m

Depth is the 7th column and niskin is the 8th column. Niskin = 0, depth = 0 for underway samples
